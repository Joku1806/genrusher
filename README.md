# genrusher

This is a toy project, attempting to solve the game [Rush Hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(puzzle)), written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/).

The code is written to run with Zig 0.12.0. As Zig is still a unstable language, please use this version to run the code. Otherwise errors related to changed language or stdlib features may show up.
